## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
Adjusting the color and style of text rather than adjusting the size of text.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
Bootswatch, awwwards, bootstrapdash, bootstrapbay.


## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I think if a site is user friendly and easy to read and navigate, people will be more inclined to use it. Cleanliness is one thing that can make a web site stand out from others. Keeping the spacing even and the text similar or nicely contrasted so it's easy on the eye.
