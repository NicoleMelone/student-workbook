## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wire-framing allows the developer to formulate an outline the entire team can see to visualize the end product. It starts with a very rough outline then as specifics are decided upon the outline becomes more in depth.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, high-fidelity. Low is useful because it is very quick and easy, just a rough sketch of an outline. If something doesn't look quite right it's a very quick fix. Mid gives a more in depth look of the outline and some specifics in key areas. If something doesn't sit quite right on the page next to something else this is the best place to see that and fix it. High is the latter part of the process where everything sits where it should be, should have the photos and buttons, and should give a very clear representation of the web page.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
YES! When you work with a team you need to make sure everyone, or the designer, agrees with the direction the site is going. It takes very little time to accomplish Low-fidelity wireframes and it can be easily adjusted then built upon. If you don't create any wireframes the chance of starting over with a project is greater if something isn't just right, especially if it's a outline problem. Starting a project over from scratch will take more time and more effort than taking the fidelity steps ahead of time.
