# Day 1 - Intro to codeworks

What I learned in coding school is how to get started and meet peers.

## Daily Journal
Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > GIT 101 and answer the following questions

### Why do we use Git?
We use Git to capture code we have created. It gives us the ablility to go back to each save and review past saves and creations. It also allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflict.

### What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
If you need to test something out before commiting multiple branches would be useful. You can keep the data and code seperate until you have everything completed then you can merge the branches together.

### What is the difference between Git and GitHub
Git is the ablility to save content and review old saves. Github is a repository where we can push our saves and keep them accessable to others.
