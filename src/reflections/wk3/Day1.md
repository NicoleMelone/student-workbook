Read Advancing with JS > ES6 modules and answer the following questions

## What problem does using exports solve?
Having the same name on multiple functions or methods is no longer a problem because each one will be in a different folder or under a different file name. 

## How does export differ from export default?
Export grabs a declaration(s) to export to another file. Export default grabs full functions or methods and allows you to grab parts of it as well in curly braces.

## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
Keeps everything seperate so you can navigate through your code easier. It also allows you to reuse the names of functions and not cause an error. Helps the debugging process and allows you to see if things are talking to eachother. Once you have all of one aspect of the DOM done you can close the file to make space for what you'll work on next.
