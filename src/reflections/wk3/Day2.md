Read Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript and answer the following questions

## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
Grouping like pieces together makes things easier to read, easier to  deal with sequencing , and easier to call numerous things without getting errors. It was created to clean up the all the chaos of having everything shoved into one folder or file and hope everything you did is in the correct order in that much code.

## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
It makes changes to the DOM harder to control. They also tell a future developer that it's a method that the user doesn't touch.

## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
If you need a method that is not for the user to touch you can use the private class to tell fellow developers it's nothing the user can change but still important to the whole project and will be used internally.
