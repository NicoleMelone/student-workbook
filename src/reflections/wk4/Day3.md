Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions

## What is the purpose of Async/Await?
It is built on promises and allows time for upload with await by having the promise watch for something. 

## What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
For this to work async must be part of the function and await should be placed with what it's waiting for and what action to take after.

## What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
It doesn't stop the rest of the page from loading in other things, it will grab the promise when it is time to finish it. When there are multiple pieces to call it makes it easier to read exactly what is being called and the order in which it will happen.
