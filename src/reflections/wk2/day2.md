Read Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
function declaration, function expression, and arrow function expression.

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are what go into the function next to the property. It's a place for an argument to be passed into. The argument is the piece of info being pushed into the parameter. It will be the specific piece of info we use instead of an acting placeholder like the parameter.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
Any function that allows another function to be passed into it's parameters.
My play function in Rock Paper Scissors accepted the computer function that was finding a random number into it. My play function was a higher order function.
