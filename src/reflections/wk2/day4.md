Read Intro to JS > The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer and answer the following questions

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
Making a plan allows you to find possible problems early on and fix them easily. It also shows you if you need to add or take something away for visual pleasure.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
debugger, google, explain the problem back to a ducky, check for syntax errors.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
Balance and never giving up. Keeping the balance of concentration and time off is one thing but indide your coding as well. If you have a good balance in your planning, the rescheach, the structure, the building, and the testing, the end result will be much closer to what your finished product will look like. Having good balance also helps you succeed in not giving up. Don't burn out too quickly, in the moment and in the entire project. If you are taking more time to figure something out than anything else, walk away. Not concentrating on one thing for too long will give your brain the time to charge and look at it from another angle. This can be working on the style and fun parts of the project for a while or walking away completely for a few minutes. 
### Balance is in all things and for all things there must be balance.
