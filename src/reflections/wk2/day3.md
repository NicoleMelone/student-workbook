## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
console.log() is used to test your connection of js to html and your test page. 
console.error('error.message') is used when there is an error you don't understand, it will print to the console and give info about the error.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab. It allows you to point to an element on the page to determine where a problem is or who is responsible for it. It will also show you borders, padding, margin so you can manipulate them.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
Use debugger throughout your writing. Each place you have an issue it will help you see it point by point so you can fix am issue quickly and before you get too far.
